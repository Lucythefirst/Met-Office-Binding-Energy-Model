# Met-Office-Binding-Energy-Model

This explores the calculation of the total binding energy, for systems of particles, using the Lennard Jones Potential.  

The scripts are written in python and use matplotlib and numpy.

The file: "first trials" defines the variables used in the Lennard Jones Potential and can be used to calculate binding
energy for object pairs of different dispersion energies. It can also generate a 
graph of binding energy vs object separation for a certain pair.

The file "first solution" is a demonstration of the calculation of the total binding energy for 3 and 6 objects.

The file "binding energy with imported values" can be used to calculate the total binding energy for many objects, when the distance between potential pairs
is listed. Object types can be distinguished, where different types may corresponds to different particles/molecules.
